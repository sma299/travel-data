# travel-data
Using data to inform the best time to travel to a destination, using APIs to deduce weather, currency, tourism levels, flight prices, and climate/political risk. Deployed to a web app.

Setup
Clone this repository onto your local computer (for example to your Desktop), then navigate there from the command-line:

`cd ~/Desktop/travel-data/`

Create and activate a new Anaconda virtual environment, perhaps named "travel-env":

`conda create -n travel-env python=3.7`

`conda activate travel-env`

Then, from within the virtual environment, install package dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
